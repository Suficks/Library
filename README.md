# Project Link [Library](https://rolling-scopes-school.github.io/suficks-JSFEPRESCHOOL2023Q2/library/)

## This is a library website where you can browse and buy books. This is one of my most complex and voluminous projects. 

### It implements the functionality of registering and authorizing users with saving data about them (including the books they purchased, the number of site visits, and the number of an individually generated LibraryCard) in Local Storage. Depending on the user's status, different page details and different modal windows are drawn. In addition, the user can “purchase” a library card and check their books and reward points without logging into their account. I'm very proud of this work!

### Used technologies: 

- HTML5
- SCSS/SASS
- JavaScript
- Registration and Authorizing users
- Webpack
- Slick slider library
- Web Storage API
